# RUST BOOTCAMP

### Phrase 1
- In Rust, if your program compiles, it probably works.

### Phrase 2
- You can't segfault if you don't have null.

### Phrase 3
- Rust doesn't hide coplexity form developers it offers them the right tools to manage all the complexity.

## 1.  Why Rust ? Isn't node.js enough ?
---
## 1.1 Type Safety
## 1.2 Systems language
It is intended to be used (but not restricted to) to do lower level things
-- Building a Compiler
-- Building a browser
-- Working closer to the OS/kernel
## 1.3 Generally faster
Rust has a separate compilation step (similar to C++) that spits out an optimised binary and does a lot of static analysis at compile time. 
## 1.4 Concurrency 
-- Rust has built-in support for concurrent programming allowing multiple threads to perform tasks simultaneously without risking data races
-- Rust has built-in support for concurrent programming allowing multiple threads to perform tasks simultaneously without risking data races
## 1.5 Memory safe
Rust has a concept of owners, borrowing and lifetimes that make it extremely memory safe
